## Running the experiments

### Dependencies 
- GMP Library: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev```.  On yum, ```sudo yum install gmp-devel```.
- Go v1.16 or later: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt-get install golang-go```.  On yum, ```sudo yum install golang```.
- OpenSSL: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```.  On yum, ```sudo yum install openssl-devel```.
- Make: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt install make```.  On yum, ```sudo yum install make```.

For optimal performance, you should compile the C code with clang-12 (approximately 10-20 percent faster than the default on some distributions).
- Clang-12: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt install clang-12```.  On yum, ```sudo yum install clang```.
  - You'll also need llvm if you use clang. 
- LLVM-AR: On Ubuntu run ```sudo apt install llvm```. On yum, ```sudo yum install llvm```.

### Datasets 
All datasets used in the paper can be obtained from https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks.

The raw data is in HDF5 format which can be converted to CSV using ```/datasets/dataconv.py``` script. 
The python script generates three files prefixed by the dataset name. 
For example, ```python dataconv.py deep1b.hdf5``` will output *deep1b_train.csv*, *deep1b_test.csv*, and *deep1b_neighbors.csv*. 

The bash script argument requires ```DATASET_PATH``` point to the directory where these three files are located as well as the dataset name predix. 
For example, to run the server on the *deep1b* data, set```DATASET_PATH=/home/user/datasets/deep1b``` (note the lack of suffix in the dataset file name).
The code will automatically locate and use the training data to build the data structure and the test data as "queries" issued by clients. 
Note that generating the hash tables for the first time can take a while; we recommend caching the results. 

### Running the servers 
Both servers must have access to the same datasets so that they can locally compute the necessary data structure. 
Each server is run automatically using the provided scripts.
There is one script per dataset. 
Each script will cycle through all experimental configurations (e.g., number of hash tables, number of probes, etc.).

#### On each server machine
0. (optional) Set the C compiler to the corresponding compiler for cgo compilation.

```
export CC=clang-12
```

1. Compile the C DPF library which is used by the Go code. 
```
cd ~/go/src/private-ann/pir/dpfc/src
make
```

2. Download and process the datasets, placing each dataset into ```~/go/src/private-ann/datasets/```.


#### On server machine A
```
cd scripts
bash mnist.sh --sid 0 
```

#### On server machine B
```
cd scripts
bash mnist.sh --sid 1
```

### Running the client 
After configuring ```client.sh``` with the server IP addresses, run
```
bash client.sh
```
which will query the servers and save the experiment results to ```../results/``` under a random ```.json``` file. 
To continuously query the servers (until all parameter combinations are exhausted), run 
```
bash clicycle.sh
```
which will spin up a new client once the servers have initialized the new experiment configuration.

### Finding dataset parameters (Optional)
Note that all paramters are already pre-computed (located in ```/ann/cmd/meanAndStd/```).
However, follow the below steps if you would like to recompute or change the way the dataset parameters are generated. 

First go to the parameters directory 
```
cd ann/cmd/parameters
go build
```
To find the mean and standard deviation of the brute force distances for a dataset
```
./parameters --dataset ../../../datasets/mnist --dimension 24
```
The dimension 24 argument cause dimensionality reduction to 24 dimensions before calculating the distances,
so the radii will account for the variance introduced by the reduction.
This is the form expected by the implementation of the 24 dimensional Leech Lattice LSH.

### Checking hash function accuracy

First go to the accuracy directory
```
cd ann/cmd/accuracy
go build
```
The accuracy script accepts parameters for many aspects of the LSH.  For example
```
./accuracy --dataset=../../../datasets/mnist --tables=10 --probes=30 --projectionwidthmean=887.77 --projectionwidthstddev=244.92 --mode=test --sequencetype=normal2
```
Evaluates the 10000 test queries for accuracy under approximation factor 2 for the MNIST dataset.
The values of width and stddev are those found with the parameter program.
To use training data to modify parameters, first run the parameter program to generate an answer set, move it into the directory, and use --mode=train.
Sequence type provides slightly different options for computing the radii.

The test.py python file contains the parameters used to run the experiments.



## Plotting! 
### Plot the LSH radii and vector distribution of each dataset. 
You can plot the parameters for each dataset (LSH radii, etc.) using the ```plot_radii.py``` script.
```
python plot_radii.py --file ../ann/cmd/parameters/mnist24x10000Data.txt --name mnist --mnist
python plot_radii.py --file ../ann/cmd/parameters/deep1b24x10000Data.txt --name deep1b
python plot_radii.py --file ../ann/cmd/parameters/sift24x10000Data.txt --name sift 
python plot_radii.py --file ../ann/cmd/parameters/gist24x10000Data.txt --name gist --maxdist 1.5
```

### Plot hash function accuracy
You can download the results of all accuracy experiments (zip file) from the following Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBfVOfjWYn-B5F1xH5_GErr-ZTuLjMfb/view?ts=61b8d3d2

```
unzip results.zip
mv acc_plot.py results 
cd results 
python acc_plot.py
```

### Plot latency 
The raw data is available in the ```paper_results``` directory. To plot it, simply run:
```
python plot_runtime.py --file ../paper_results/mnist_results.json --mnist --cap -1
python plot_runtime.py --file ../paper_results/deep1b_results.json
python plot_runtime.py --file ../paper_results/sift_results.json
python plot_runtime.py --file ../paper_results/gist_results.json
```

### Plot PBR overheads 
```
python pbrsim.py 
```
